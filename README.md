# lullcache

Something that looks like Memcached in Golang. Probably not wire compatible. Mainly for funsies and something to hack on during over the weekend.

Obviously, an in-memory cache written in a garbage collected language is probably a bad ideaâ€” hence the name lullcache. Let those GC pauses lull your code to sleep!
